# Python Fundamental Learning - 90 Days Challenge

This repository tracks my 90-day journey to master Python fundamentals through continuous practice and learning.

## Goals
- Practice Python daily for 90 days
- Build a strong foundation in Python programming
- Document progress and learnings

## Structure
- `day_01/` - Day 1 practice files
- `day_02/` - Day 2 practice files
- ...
- `README.md` - This file

## Daily Practice Plan
1. Basic syntax and data types
2. Control structures (loops, conditionals)
3. Functions and modules
4. Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
5. File handling
6. Object-oriented programming
7. Error handling
8. Advanced topics (decorators, generators, etc.)
9. Projects and applications
